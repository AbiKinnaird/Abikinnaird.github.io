    <h5> <span class="w3-opacity">September, 2023</span></h5>
    <p>This project involved the construction of an interactive Python coded dashboard. 
      This dashboard is used to visualise and understand a Random Forest model which is trained to detect fraud.

      <h3><b>Prediction of Functionality of Water pumps</b></h3>
      <h5> <span class="w3-opacity">May, 2022</span></h5>
      <p>This paper compares the performance of different
        machine learning algorithms in their ability to predict the
        functional status of a water pumps in Tanzania, along with an
        investigation into which feature is most important in predicting
        this status. </p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Two distinct methods are outlined. My method is Method 1. Each method
        includes separate data preprocessing steps which are then applied
        to two different machine learning models (random forest, decision
        tree for method 1, and multinominal logistic regression and k-
        nearest neighbours for method 2). Random forest was found to
        have the highest predictive power, with an accuracy and f1 score
        of 80.0% and 78.7% respectively, and was therefore concluded
        to be the most successful model in predicting functional status.
        Overall, the dry category of the feature quantity was found to
        be the most important predictor of functionality.</p>
